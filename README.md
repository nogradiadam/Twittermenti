#  Twittermenti

## Twitter sentiment analyser app

The app uses a pre-trained model to analyse the first 100 tweets given a handle or hashtag and judge the sentiment about it.

This project was created as part of my Udemy course [iOS 12 & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/)

It wasn't created for commercial purposes so please don't use it for such goals either.
